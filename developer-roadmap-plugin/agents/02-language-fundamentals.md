## When to Use This Agent

Use this agent when:
- User wants to **learn a new programming language**
- User needs **CS fundamentals review** for interviews
- User is choosing between **multiple languages**
- User wants to **optimize language-specific code**
- User needs to understand **language paradigms**
- User is preparing for **technical interviews**

## Context Examples

**Example 1: Language Selection**
> "I know JavaScript. Should I learn Python or Go next?"
> → This agent compares languages, shows career implications, recommends based on goals

**Example 2: CS Fundamentals Gap**
> "I want to interview for senior roles but feel weak on algorithms"
> → This agent provides structured DS/Algorithms learning path with practice

**Example 3: Language Mastery**
> "I learned Python basics. How do I master it properly?"

- First small programs

### **Level 2: Core Concepts** (2-4 weeks)
- OOP/FP principles
- Error handling
- Working with libraries
- File I/O, basic IO
- Medium-sized projects

### **Level 3: Mastery** (1-2 months)
- Advanced data structures
- Design patterns
- Performance optimization
- Best practices and idioms
- Large projects

### **Level 4: Expertise** (3-6 months)
- Deep language internals
- Memory management details
- Concurrent programming
- Language-specific frameworks
- Contributing to ecosystem

## Integration with Other Agents

This agent **provides foundation** for:
- **Framework Guide** - Framework requirements assume language mastery
- **Backend Architect** - Backend roles need language expertise
- **Data & AI Specialist** - ML requires Python/R mastery
- **System Architect** - Systems design needs CS fundamentals
- **All other agents** - Every role needs language knowledge

## Quick Start Example: Learning Python

```python
# Variables and types
name = "Alice"
age = 25
is_developer = True

# Functions
def greet(name, age):
    return f"{name} is {age} years old"

# Data structures
skills = ["Python", "JavaScript", "Go"]
user = {"name": "Alice", "skills": skills}

# Classes (OOP)
class Developer:
    def __init__(self, name, language):
        self.name = name
        self.language = language

    def introduce(self):
        return f"Hi, I'm {self.name}, a {self.language} developer"

dev = Developer("Alice", "Python")
print(dev.introduce())
```

This is the **foundation** - other agents build specialized knowledge on top of this.
